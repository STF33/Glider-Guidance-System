# **Manual: `read_hycom` Function**

## **Purpose**:
The function `read_hycom` reads HYCOM binary archive files which represent model outputs. It then returns a specified field and the dimensions of the grid.

---

### **1. Preliminary Steps and Initializations**:
- **Import Necessary Libraries**: 
```python
import numpy as np
import sys
```

- **Specify the HYCOM binary archive files**: 
```python
a = 'path_to_file_a'
b = 'path_to_file_b'
```

---

### **2. Identifying the Grid Dimensions**:
- The function opens the '.b' file and reads through its contents to determine the grid dimensions (`IDM` x `JDM`). 

---

### **3. Locating the Requested Field**:
- The function looks for the requested field (`fld`) in the '.b' file.
- If the requested field is found, its location (`FLOC`) is noted. Otherwise, an exception is raised.

---

### **4. Determining the Vertical Layers and Tracers**:
- The function checks for the number of vertical layers and tracers for the requested field.
- It can also specifically target certain layers (`rLayer`) and tracers (`Rtrc`) based on provided arguments. If not specified, all layers and tracers will be considered.

---

### **5. Reading the Data From Binary Files**:
- The function now opens the '.a' file in binary mode.
- For each layer in the range specified (or all layers if not specified), the function:
  1. Computes the position (`seek_position`) in the file to jump to.
  2. Reads a chunk of data corresponding to that layer.
  3. Reshapes the data and stacks it.
- If there's no data found for the specified field, the function prints a warning.

---

### **6. Using `read_hycom` to Fetch Data**:
- Fetching data for a specific field (`u-vel.` for example) can be done as follows:
```python
u_vel_data, IDM_u, JDM_u, ll_u = read_hycom(a, b, 'u-vel.')
```

---

## **Additional Notes**:
- **Exception Handling**: The function includes various checks and raises exceptions if issues like file not being found, requested field not existing, etc. are encountered.
- **Debugging**: The function includes commented debugging lines which can be uncommented for additional insight into its operation.
- **Performance**: For improved performance and reduced memory usage, the function can be specified to read specific layers instead of all layers.
- **Function Comments**: The provided function has a detailed multi-line string comment that provides additional context on its usage and options.

---

## **How to Use**:
1. Ensure the necessary libraries are imported.
2. Specify the paths to your '.a' and '.b' HYCOM binary archive files.
3. Call the `read_hycom` function with the desired field.
4. Process or inspect the returned data as needed.

**Example**:
To fetch the 'temp' field data:
```python
temp_data, IDM_temp, JDM_temp, ll_temp = read_hycom(a, b, 'temp')
```

For the 'u-vel.' and 'v-vel.' fields:
```python
u_vel_data, IDM_u, JDM_u, ll_u = read_hycom(a, b, 'u-vel.')
v_vel_data, IDM_v, JDM_v, ll_v = read_hycom(a, b, 'v-vel.')
```

You can then print or further process the `u_vel_data` and `v_vel_data` arrays as needed.
